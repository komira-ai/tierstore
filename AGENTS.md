# AGENTS.md

The rules every change to this repository is written and reviewed against, by people and coding agents alike. `CLAUDE.md` imports this
file (its one line is `@AGENTS.md`), so every agent reads the same text.

The file has three parts: the shared core, the same text word for word in every repository of the project; the Rust rules, since this
repository's code is Rust; and this repository's own rules. Rules are cited by id.

The shared core is the text between the two marker lines below. `cargo test -p xtask --test agents_md` (in `crates/xtask/tests/agents_md.rs`)
fails when it differs from the checked-in copy `docs/agents/shared_core.md`, when that copy differs from its hash in
`docs/agents/shared_core.sha256`, or when `CLAUDE.md` no longer imports this file; a change to the core changes all three in one pull
request.

<!-- shared-core:begin -->
## 1. Shared core

Severity: BLOCK must be fixed before merge. SHOULD is fixed unless the author gives a reason.

### Tests and coverage

- T1 BLOCK. Every touched package or crate is at least 99% line and 99% branch as measured by the PR check. Aim 100%; never demand above 99. Check: the coverage job table. Fix: add behaviour tests for the uncovered lines and branches.
- T2 SHOULD. Coverage means line and branch percent. Reject claims based on test-file or test-function counts.
- T3 BLOCK. No coverage floor or baseline is lowered or set below 99, and no shared coverage census or shared ratchet file is added. Floors live in each package. Check: diff of floor/baseline files.
- T4 BLOCK. Do not hide code from measurement: no `#[cfg(not(coverage))]`, `#[coverage(off)]`, moving a crate into `exclude`, `test = false` binaries. A `main.rs` only forwards to its library. Check: grep the diff.
- T5 BLOCK. A bug fix ships a test that failed before the fix and is wired in (`#[test]` in the crate; named in `test_srcs` for Mojo). Check: find the test, read it against the pre-fix code, check the PR text says what it asserts.
- T7 BLOCK. Never edit a test green over a capability gap: no weakened or deleted assertions, no tests removed from `test_srcs`, no `tests_known_failing`.
- T8 BLOCK. Tests assert behaviour. The PR body lists tests by name with the behaviour each proves. A "Catches ..." line is allowed; stating the defect caught is SHOULD.
- T9 BLOCK. No mutant bookkeeping in code or PR text: no mutant tables, planted-defect run ids, "seen red" notes, or test names/comments mentioning mutants. Check: grep diff and PR body for `mutant`, `seen red`, `planted defect`.
- T10 BLOCK. Tests never assert timing: no elapsed-time bounds, latency ceilings, or sleeps racing real timeouts. Inject a clock or use explicit progress events. Check: grep for `Instant::now`, `elapsed`, `sleep(`, `perf_counter`, timeout races used as pass/fail.
- T11 BLOCK. Tests are written in the component's own language. No new shell or Python tests (`*_selftest.sh`, `tests/*.sh`, `py_test`), and no growth of existing shell selftests, except for the Python SDK surface. New cases go to a Rust tool with Rust tests.
- T12 BLOCK. Tests are hermetic and deterministic: no network or DNS (use fakes), no hard-coded ports or fixed paths, no shared state between tests, no silent skip (a skip states its reason), no retry-until-green. Use the repo's scratch helpers; tests never touch the host's real service directories.
- T13 SHOULD. Tests cover failure and boundary cases, not only the happy path. A no-leak or redaction test asserts the full message by exact equality.
- T15 BLOCK. A new gate, lint, or check has a negative case that fails on a defect. A warm cached green does not prove a closure change. Describe it as a behaviour test (T9 applies).
- T19 SHOULD. A behaviour change updates goldens and any docs describing it in the same PR; a generator or codegen change moves its goldens in the same PR (BLOCK for codegen).

### Design and change shape

- B8 BLOCK. Formats change additively only: new optional field, record type, oneof case, table, or column-with-default. Reject renumbering, wire renames, removing or re-meaning a shipped field, new required fields, refusing unknown data, or raising a version floor. The PR names the test that runs the previous release on new data and vice versa.
- B20 SHOULD. Do not answer a config mistake with runtime machinery (gates, counters, extra metrics, dry-runs). Fix the config at the source and check it once at deploy. No speculative abstractions or ports without a concrete use case.
- B22 SHOULD. A change touching more than one package, or taking more than a day to reverse, links a design doc. Moving or deleting a package needs the supersession check.
- P7 SHOULD. One subject per PR. Refactors are split from behaviour changes; interfaces land before the code that uses them.
- P10 SHOULD. Docs, headers, and comments describe only what the code does. Flag any doc the diff contradicts or leaves stale (BLOCK when a header contradicts its code).

### CI and workflows

- B9 BLOCK. A PR runs only build and unit tests with coverage. Reject release dry-runs, a `pull_request` trigger on a release workflow, new PR-gate jobs, slow tests in the PR set, and darwin/macOS jobs or targets in per-PR checks. Advisories never block; licences/bans/sources do.
- B10 BLOCK. Workflows: hosted runners only (no self-hosted or paid), actions pinned by commit SHA, no `pull_request_target`, external tools pinned by URL and SHA-256. Workflows are actionlint clean.
- B12 SHOULD. Releases are automatic from main: no manual tag step, no bake/gamma-verdict evaluator.

### PR text and commits

- P1 SHOULD. The title says concretely what changes. No vague words: trustworthy, harden, robust, improve.
- P2 SHOULD. The body leads with the user-facing change (before and after, and what does not change); then a layer-by-layer walk in reading order with the why; then compatibility and failure modes; then tests by name with the behaviour each asserts. Plain language. Suggest a split if part can land alone.
- P3 BLOCK. Commit messages cite issues as `Refs <owner>/<repo>#<n>`, never `Fixes`, `Closes`, `Resolves`. A bare `#12` is SHOULD; name the repo.
- P4 SHOULD. Authors commit under their own identity. A commit written with a model ends with a `Co-authored-by:` trailer naming that model. Repos enforcing DCO: every commit, merge commits included, has a `Signed-off-by:` trailer matching the author email (BLOCK there).
- P5 SHOULD. History is not rewritten: no `fixup!`/`squash!` commits, no force-push, no amend or rebase of pushed commits. A correction is a new commit saying what it corrects.
- P6 BLOCK. The PR contains only paths for its purpose. No `.claude/agent-memory/**`, scratch, logs, `.out` files, or unrelated churn. Check: file list.
- P8 SHOULD. Stacked PRs: the body states the stack and merge order; the base is main at merge time; stacked trains land with merge commits, not squash.
- P9 BLOCK. CI ran on the PR head SHA, not a stale merge ref. Compare the CI run SHA with the head SHA.
- P11 SHOULD. Every number in PR text (tests, callers, PRs, cache percentages) names the query that produced it and separates measured from inferred.

### Secrets and configuration

- S1 BLOCK. No secret, token, key, endpoint address, or worker property set committed. No remote-execution endpoint or `instance_name` committed. Check: grep for URLs with ports, bearer tokens, private keys, `AWS_`/`GOOGLE_` key material, `remote_execution` keys.
- S2 BLOCK. Configuration is passed as flags, not environment variables. Allowed env: platform-set mode markers, secret material, provider-standard credentials (`AWS_*`, `GOOGLE_*`). Check: grep for `getenv`, `std::env::var`, `env::var_os`, `os.environ`; judge each against the three exceptions.
- S3 BLOCK. A diff must not make a cluster write, upload, deploy, or cloud spend executable by default, or run against a gamma or prod account. Steps only the owner runs are held scripts: dry-run default, never forcing, `bash -n` clean, in the documented location.
- S4 SHOULD. Committed scripts and docs use the workspace scratch directory, not `/tmp`. No `rm -rf` in scripts; use the scratch-removal tool.
<!-- shared-core:end -->

## 2. Rust

tierstore is a Cargo workspace of Rust crates; these are the rules of its code. The tool of T11 is a Rust test or a `cargo xtask` verb here.

- R1 BLOCK. `cargo fmt --all --check` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings` are green. No new `#[allow(...)]`/`#![allow(...)]` without a stated reason.
- R2 BLOCK. No new `unsafe`. The `unsafe` this workspace has is the libc calls and environment edits of the test helper `tierstore-testkit`, each with a `// SAFETY:` comment; a change adds none, and `tierstore`, which has `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, keeps it.
- R3 BLOCK. No new `.unwrap()` or `.expect(` in production paths. Libraries use `thiserror` enums with context; `anyhow` only in binaries; no `Box<dyn Error>` in library signatures.
- R6 BLOCK. Dependencies come from crates.io (or pinned sibling-repo revisions) with a permissive licence; `cargo deny` licences, bans, and sources pass. Advisories (RUSTSEC) never block a PR.
- R7 BLOCK. Manifests parse after the merge: no duplicate keys or merge artifacts in changed `Cargo.toml`.
- R8 BLOCK. Crate drift: if main changed anything under a crate this PR touches (`crates/<crate>/`, including src, tests, Cargo files) since CI ran, require main merged and a fresh CI run. Check: `git diff head...main -- crates/<crate>`.
- R9 SHOULD. Minimal public API: small trait bounds, ownership visible in signatures, newtypes, no trait with a single implementation, no speculative abstraction.
- R12 SHOULD. Files stay under 1000 lines; a file already over 1000 lines does not grow.
- T17 SHOULD. Rust coverage: do not rely on tests the PR profile skips; arms of one function covered only by different test binaries or generic instantiations count as missed.

## 3. This repository

- B16 BLOCK. kbf/tierstore data paths: action commands run network-less in the job container (explicit logged opt-in only). Outputs are read once (hash and store in one pass), no blob size cap, no whole-file buffering. Jobs write only to their own output path with no delete privilege.
- B17 SHOULD. Host updates use one generic updater with per-service update-hook subcommands declared in a root-owned file; no per-roll scripts or per-service logic in the updater.
- B10 BLOCK (this repository). Every workflow also has a top-level `permissions: {}`, and a write scope is held only by the jobs, and under the `if:`, that the workflow lint lists for it.

Where the rules above are checked in this repository: format, licences, bans and sources, and clippy (R1, R6) by CI's `lint` job;
coverage (T1, T3) by `coverage-gate` in CI's `test` job, which judges every crate of the workspace at 99.00% of its lines and of its
branches with no exclusion; workflow runners, triggers, permissions and action pins (B10) by the workflow lint,
`cargo test -p xtask --test workflows`; this file and `CLAUDE.md` by `cargo test -p xtask --test agents_md`.
