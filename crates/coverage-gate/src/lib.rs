//! Per-crate line and branch coverage for the workspace, and the gate that keeps it up.
//!
//! CI runs the tests under `cargo llvm-cov --branch`, which writes an lcov tracefile. This crate
//! reads it ([`lcov`]), sums its per-file counts into one [`CrateCoverage`] per directory under
//! `crates/` ([`gate::by_crate`]) and fails any crate whose line or branch coverage is under
//! [`Percent::TARGET`], 99.00%, unless the crate is named as excluded (the repository's own
//! tooling and test helpers, which are tested but not measured against the gate).
//!
//! Percentages are floored to hundredths ([`Percent`]), so one uncovered line in a
//! large crate shows as 99.99%, never as a rounded-up 100.00%. The gate compares in
//! integers (`hit * 10000 >= percent * found`, see [`Counts::meets`]), never floats.
