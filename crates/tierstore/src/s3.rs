//! [`S3Backend`]: a [`Backend`] over the S3 client of `objstore-s3` (feature `s3`).
//!
//! The backend is an adapter and keeps no state: each call of the trait is the S3 request of
//! the same meaning, sent by the client the workspace already has (path-style addressing,
//! SigV4, a timeout on every request), and each answer is read into this crate's [`Error`].
//!
//! - `put` is a PUT with `If-None-Match: *`; the 412 is [`Error::AlreadyExists`]. Create-only
//!   (here, in `put_stream` and in `complete_upload`) needs a store that honours conditional
//!   writes: one that ignores `If-None-Match` on a put or on the completion of a multipart upload
//!   would replace an object that exists.
//! - `put_stream` is the store client's streamed write, given the chunks of the body as they
//!   arrive and their total length (the `Content-Length` of the request; without one the body
//!   is held first, since S3 takes no request of unknown length). A body of at most 16 MiB is
//!   gathered and sent as one PUT with `If-None-Match: *`; a longer one is a multipart upload
//!   whose parts are sent as they fill, completed with `If-None-Match: *` only after the body
//!   has ended with exactly its length, and aborted on any failure. Either way the object comes
//!   into being in the last request, after the whole body was read and checked by the caller, so
//!   a body that ends with an error, or is cut short, leaves no object and no staged key, and
//!   at most 16 MiB of the body is held at a time. A key that exists is
//!   [`Error::AlreadyExists`].
//! - `put_if_match` is a PUT with `If-Match: "<tag>"` (a tag given in quotes is not quoted
//!   twice); the 412 is [`Error::PreconditionFailed`] and a 404 is [`Error::NotFound`]. It
//!   gives the `ETag` of the answer, without its quotes.
//! - `get` is a GET, with `Range: bytes=<first>-<last>` for a range.
//! - `head` is a HEAD: `Content-Length`, `ETag` (the content tag, without its quotes, as the
//!   other backends give it and the S3 front, which quotes it, expects) and `Last-Modified`.
//! - `delete` is a DELETE; a 404 is a success.
//! - `list` and `list_page` are ListObjectsV2 with `prefix`, a `max-keys` of at most 1000,
//!   `start-after` on the first request and the `continuation-token` of each answer on the
//!   next. A page that repeats the token it was sent ends the listing with an
//!   [`Error::Other`].
//! - `create_upload` is CreateMultipartUpload and gives the upload id of the store.
//! - `upload_part_with_len` is UploadPart whose body is the chunks of the part as they
//!   arrive, never collected: the request carries the length as its `Content-Length`, is
//!   signed with `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD`, and ends with the body, so a part of any size is held a
//!   few chunks at a time. A body that gives an error, also after its last byte, or more or
//!   fewer bytes than the length, stores nothing and gives that error ([`Error::Other`] for
//!   the length). `upload_part`, for a caller that does not know the length, holds the whole
//!   part first, since S3 takes no part of unknown length. The tag of a part is the `ETag` of
//!   the answer without its quotes, which is how the S3 front names a part to its client and
//!   how a completion names it again. The signature of a part carries no hash of its bytes, so
//!   the store has none to check them against; the connection is plain HTTP (the client
//!   refuses TLS), so a part is as safe on its way as the network between the proxy and the
//!   store.
//! - `complete_upload` is CompleteMultipartUpload with `If-None-Match: *`, so a key that
//!   exists is [`Error::AlreadyExists`] and the upload stays open. It gives the `ETag` the
//!   answer names for the object (without its quotes), which is what `head` gives it too, and
//!   needs no second request, which could fail after the object was made. On S3 the tag
//!   of an object made of parts is not the MD5 of its bytes, so it is not the tag of a `put`
//!   of the same bytes, unlike in the in-memory and the directory backend.
//! - `abort_upload` is AbortMultipartUpload.
//! - `list_uploads` is ListMultipartUploads (`prefix`, `max-uploads`, `key-marker` and
//!   `upload-id-marker`), whose pages the backend follows until it has the uploads asked for or
//!   the listing ends.
//! - An upload the store does not hold (`NoSuchUpload`) is [`Error::NotFound`] with the upload
//!   id, and a completion the store refuses for its parts (`InvalidPart`, `InvalidPartOrder`,
//!   `EntityTooSmall`) is [`Error::InvalidPart`]. S3 takes no part under 5 MiB but the last.
//!
//! Notes on the mapping:
//!
//! - S3 answers 416 to a range that starts at or past the end of the object, and a range of
//!   length zero is no request at all. The trait wants no bytes for a range starting at the
//!   end and an [`Error::Other`] for one starting past it, so a HEAD decides both, and finds
//!   out whether the key exists. A 416 to a range that holds bytes of the object is an
//!   [`Error::Other`] too, not an empty read.
//! - A store reads the positions of a `Range` as signed 64-bit numbers, so a range that
//!   runs past 2^63 - 1 is cut there before it is sent (the object cannot be longer).
//! - A listing of more than 1000 objects is several requests: `list_page` follows the
//!   continuation tokens until it has `max_keys` objects or the listing ends, since a page
//!   shorter than `max_keys` means the last.
//! - The content tag is the `ETag`, without its quotes. S3 makes it the MD5 of the bytes of an object written by
//!   one PUT, which is what every write of this backend is, so equal bytes have equal tags
//!   in two buckets of one kind of store. A store that encrypts with keys of its own makes
//!   the tag from something else: compare tags only between backends of one store.
//! - `modified` of a [`Meta`] is the `Last-Modified` of a HEAD, in whole seconds. That of a
//!   [`Listed`] is the `LastModified` of the listing, as fine as the store sends it (MinIO
//!   sends milliseconds), so the two times of one object need not be equal.
//! - Keys must be ones the client can name without escaping (`A-Z a-z 0-9 - _ . ~`, and `/`
//!   between non-empty segments); any other key is an [`Error::Other`] before a request is
//!   made. The `start_after` of `list_page` is named as a key as well, so one that is not
//!   nameable (`a/`, say) is refused although another backend takes any string.
//! - A request that did not complete, and the statuses 408, 429 and every 5xx but 501 and 507,
//!   are [`Error::Unavailable`] (a server error may be gone on the next try). 507
//!   (Insufficient Storage, which is how MinIO reports a full drive) is [`Error::Full`]. 501 (Not
//!   Implemented: the store does not do what was asked) and anything else that is not a success
//!   is [`Error::Other`]. A 409 `ConditionalRequestConflict` (two writers racing a conditional
//!   write of one key; the store does not say which won) is [`Error::Unavailable`]: a retry is
//!   answered 412 if the other writer won.
//!
//! Each request is bounded by the `request_timeout` of the [`S3Config`], and a read is sent
//! again after a failure in transport; a write never is. A part is the exception to the bound:
//! it is as slow as the client that sends it, so only a part that makes no progress for the
//! `request_timeout` is cut, as an [`Error::Unavailable`].
