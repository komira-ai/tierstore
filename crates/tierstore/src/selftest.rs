//! A self-test of a backend's contract, run before a backend is used.
//!
//! The proxy, the lease and the journal rest on answers that a store must give exactly: a
//! create-only put that refuses a key that exists, a put that replaces only on the right content
//! tag, a ranged read that gives the range and nothing else, a head that gives the size and the
//! tag of what was written, a listing that pages by `start_after`, and (on the tier that takes
//! multipart uploads) a completion that is create-only. A store that answers one of them wrongly
//! does not fail: it overwrites silently, and the guarantees built on it are gone.
//! [`self_test`] asks each question on a key of its own, and says which answer was wrong.
//!
//! Two outcomes are kept apart. A store that answered, and wrongly, is a [`SelfTestFailure`]
//! (a [`SelfTestError::Violation`]): fixing it takes a different store, so a restart is no use.
//! A store that could not be asked ([`Error::Unavailable`]: down, a timeout, a refused
//! connection, and for the S3 backend a 408, 429 or any 5xx but 501 and 507) is asked again, after
//! pauses that double up to a longest, for as long as [`SelfTestOptions::wait`] allows, and then
//! is a [`SelfTestError::Unreachable`], which a restart may mend. A store that is full
//! ([`Error::Full`], a state the hot tier is designed to be in) is not in doubt: the checks that
//! need a write are skipped, with a note, and the test passes. Any other error is an answer the
//! contract does not allow, and a violation.
//!
//! The probe keys are under `_tiering/selftest/<run id>/`, a prefix a client never sees (the
//! `_tiering/` prefix is reserved), and the caller gives a run id that is new for each start.
//! The keys of a check are deleted after it, whether it passed or not (a delete that fails is
//! noted). Keys under the prefix that are older than an hour, left by a start that was killed,
//! are deleted by [`sweep_probes`], which is not part of [`self_test`] so that a caller can run it
//! when the start no longer waits for it. At most the first thousand keys are looked at, and a
//! sweep is bounded by a [`SweepBudget`] (by default 100 deletes, and no new delete starts after
//! 10 seconds on the clock it is given; a request already sent runs to the end of its own
//! timeout); what it leaves waits for the next start, and its note says so. Only keys that
//! start with the probe prefix and are not this run's are deleted, whatever a listing returns, and
//! the age is judged by the clock of the store (the `Last-Modified` of a key the sweep writes for
//! the purpose and deletes), not by the clock of the machine, which may be minutes from that of
//! another machine over the same bucket.
//!
//! The test sees a backend through the [`Backend`] trait, so it asks what the trait promises: the
//! S3 backend turns a store's answers into those promises (`If-None-Match: *` answered 412 is
//! [`Error::AlreadyExists`], a reply of 200 to a `Range` request is an error, a HEAD with no
//! `Last-Modified` is an error), and a store that breaks one shows up here as the error or the
//! wrong answer it gave. What the trait hides is not tested: a continuation token or
//! `IsTruncated` (the S3 backend follows tokens itself and cuts a page at `max_keys`, so a store
//! that ignores `max-keys` is not seen), and the value of the time of the last write. Of the
//! multipart calls only the create-only completion is tested, not the refusal of a bad part list.
