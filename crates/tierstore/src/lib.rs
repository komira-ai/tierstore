//! A hot/cold object store over S3-compatible backends.
//!
//! The crate knows nothing of what is stored: objects are immutable byte strings under string
//! keys, and it has no crate of the workspace it lives in among its normal dependencies, so that
//! it can move to a repository of its own. The one exception is the feature `s3` (off by
//! default), which adds `S3Backend`, an adapter over the S3 client of `objstore-s3`; its tests
//! use two crates of the workspace as dev-dependencies, which stay behind.
//!
//! - [`Backend`] is the minimal API of an S3-compatible store: a create-only put (it fails
//!   with [`Error::AlreadyExists`] where the key exists, as `If-None-Match: *` does), a put
//!   that replaces an object only if it has a given content tag (`If-Match`, for the few
//!   small objects the crate rewrites), get with an optional byte range, head (size, content
//!   tag and time of last write), delete, and list by prefix, whole or a page at a time. Its
//!   methods are async, as the object store clients of the workspace are, and boxed so that a
//!   backend is used as `dyn Backend`. It also has the four calls of a multipart upload
//!   (create, upload a part from a stream of chunks, complete, abort), which a backend need
//!   not override: the provided ones answer [`Error::Unsupported`]. A backend whose store
//!   must know the length of a part before it is sent overrides
//!   [`Backend::upload_part_with_len`] too, which the S3 front calls with the `Content-Length`
//!   of the request.
//! - [`MemoryBackend`] is an in-memory backend whose times come from a [`TestClock`] that a
//!   test sets by hand, and [`FaultyBackend`] wraps a backend to fail or delay chosen calls
//!   and to count them: both are for tests. [`DirBackend`] keeps a bucket in a directory of the
//!   local file system, parts of uploads included, which are streamed to files.
//! - `S3Backend` (feature `s3`, in the module `s3`) is a bucket of an S3-compatible store as
//!   a [`Backend`]: a create-only put is `If-None-Match: *`, a put that replaces is
//!   `If-Match`, a get is a ranged GET, a head gives the `ETag` as the content tag, and a
//!   listing follows the continuation tokens. It does the multipart calls too: the chunks of
//!   a part are sent to the store as they arrive, never collected, and a completion is
//!   create-only.
//! - [`self_test`] asks a backend the questions its guarantees rest on (a create-only put that
//!   refuses a key that exists, a replace on the right content tag only, a ranged read that
//!   gives the range, a head, a listing that pages, and on the cold tier a create-only
//!   completion) under a probe key in `_tiering/selftest/`, and names the first one it answers
//!   wrongly (a [`SelfTestError::Violation`]; a store it could not ask is
//!   [`SelfTestError::Unreachable`], and one that is full is not in doubt). The `tierstore`
//!   binary runs it on both tiers and refuses to start if one answers wrongly.
//! - [`Proxy`] is a store over a hot and a cold backend that is itself a [`Backend`]. Any
//!   number of proxies (one per node, each with its own id) work over the same two backends,
//!   and none needs state for correctness. A get reads the hot tier, else the cold tier, and
//!   copies what it found in the cold tier back into the hot tier; a head does not. A put is
//!   refused if the key exists in either tier, is written to the hot tier, and is
//!   acknowledged only after an entry for it is durable in a journal object
//!   `_journal/<proxy_id>/<seq>` in the hot tier. A delete removes the object from both tiers
//!   and journals the delete. A listing merges the two tiers. When the hot tier is full the
//!   proxy writes new objects straight to the cold tier. A multipart upload goes straight to
//!   the cold tier, part by part, never staged in the proxy: it creates the object there only
//!   when the upload is completed (create-only: a key that exists in either tier is refused),
//!   and journals nothing, as a put to the cold tier of a full hot tier does not; a read copies
//!   the object into the hot tier.
//! - [`Reconciler`] is the one runner, guarded by a lease object in the hot tier. It tails
//!   the journals, copies each put from the hot tier to the cold tier (in parallel, bounded),
//!   applies the deletes, records how far it got in a checkpoint per proxy, evicts the
//!   oldest copied objects from the hot tier when it is over its high-water mark, deletes old
//!   journal objects, and publishes the hot tier's usage and the copy lag. It never lists
//!   the data prefixes of either tier: it lists `_tiering/proxies/` and the journal prefix of
//!   each proxy, and reads the journal objects, the checkpoints, the lease and the usage.
//! - [`CachedStore`] answers repeated reads of an object's ranges from RAM in front of any
//!   backend, typically a [`Proxy`]. It is a cache of the node it runs on, not state.
//!
//! The keys under `_journal/` and `_tiering/` belong to the proxy and the reconciler: a
//! client put or delete there is refused, and a listing leaves them out.
//!
//! Every proxy, reconciler and cache takes its settings as constructor parameters.
//!
//! With the `server` feature the crate also has the `server` module, the S3 API front of a
//! [`Proxy`] (the calls of S3 clients, signed with SigV4, answered from the two tiers, with
//! request bodies and answers that must make progress and checksums that are verified), and the
//! `tierstore` binary, which runs a proxy, that front and a [`Reconciler`] in one process
//! (`cargo build -p tierstore --features server`), over memory, directory or S3 tiers; the
//! feature turns `s3` on.
//!
//! The same feature adds a read-only OCI distribution front, over HTTPS or over plain HTTP on
//! loopback (`--oci-listen`, `server::oci`), which serves the objects under a key prefix by
//! their SHA-256 digest, so that a container engine pulls an image from the tiers.
