/// or a file the backend keeps for itself (their names start with `.`). A key whose name is
/// empty or longer than 255 bytes is refused with [`Error::Other`]. The file holds the SHA-256
/// of the body, which is the content tag, and then the body, so that a head reads 32 bytes and
/// not the object.
///
/// - A put writes a temporary file in the directory, syncs it, and hard-links it to the name,
///   which fails where the name is taken: the object appears whole or not at all, and a put of a
///   key that exists leaves it as it was. The directory needs a file system with hard links. A
///   crash leaves a `.tmp-` file behind, which is never listed and can be removed when the
///   process is stopped. The file is synced before it is linked, and the directory is synced
///   after the link, so that the name of an object whose put was acknowledged survives a power
///   loss. A replacement ([`Backend::put_if_match`]), a delete, the placing of a part and the
///   completion of an upload sync the directory they changed the same way, before they return.
///   If the sync after a link fails the name is removed again, so that an object that was not
///   acknowledged is not left visible and a retry can succeed (if the name cannot be removed the
///   error says it may exist without being durable). A replacement or a delete whose sync fails
///   cannot be undone, the old body being gone: the call fails and the change may be visible; a
///   retry of a delete is fine, and the caller of a replacement reads the object to see which
///   body it holds.
/// - A streamed put ([`Backend::put_stream`]) writes the chunks to the temporary file as they
///   arrive, so that the body is never held in memory; the content tag, which starts the file,
///   is written over reserved room after the last chunk, the file is synced, and only then is it
///   linked to the name, with the directory synced after the link as for any put. A body that
///   fails leaves no object and removes the temporary file.
/// - A multipart upload is a directory `.uploads/<id>` that holds a file with the key and a file
///   for each part, written as the chunks of the part arrive, so that a part is never held in
///   memory; the completion joins the parts into the new object by streaming them, and removes
///   the upload. The uploads are files, so an upload outlives a restart of the process, and an
///   upload that is never completed or aborted stays until it is aborted.
///
