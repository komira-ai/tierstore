//! The hand-over of the body of a put to the call of the backend that stores it, which runs on
//! a task of its own.
//!
//! The request reads its body a piece at a time, checks the pieces against the hashes the
//! request claims, and passes them on through a queue of [`PIECES_QUEUED`] pieces; the backend
//! takes them from the other end as a stream. The queue is what holds the memory of a put to a
//! few pieces: when the backend is slow the request stops reading, whatever the length of the
//! object.
//!
//! The stream ends cleanly only if the request says so, after it has read the whole body and
//! every hash came out right. A stream whose request is gone (the client went away, so the
//! request was dropped) without saying so ends with an error, so a backend never takes a cut
//! body for a whole one.
