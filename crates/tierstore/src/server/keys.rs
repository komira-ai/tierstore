//! The access keys of the S3 front: what a key may do, which key a request names, and the
//! files the keys are read from.
//!
//! A server has one full key, which may do everything the front serves
//! ([`ServerConfig::access_key_id`]), and any number of read-only keys
//! ([`ServerConfig::read_only_keys`]), which may do GetObject, HeadObject, ListObjectsV2,
//! ListMultipartUploads, HeadBucket, GetBucketLocation, ListBuckets and the reads of the settings
//! of the bucket (`?versioning`, `?policy` and the rest, which answer as S3 does for a bucket
//! with none set) and nothing else: any other call signed by one is answered 403 `AccessDenied`
//! before its body is read, and changes nothing. A request names its key by the id in its
//! credential, so the ids of the keys of one server differ ([`ensure_distinct`], which the
//! binary applies at start).
//!
//! A credentials file (the file of `--access-key-file`, `--read-only-key-file`,
//! `--hot-credentials-file` or `--cold-credentials-file`) holds one key either as JSON,
//! `{"access_key_id": "...", "secret_access_key": "..."}`, which is what a pack flag that takes a key
//! reads (`access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`; tierstore also refuses any other field and an
//! empty value, and takes the values as they are, without trimming), or as two lines: the id on
//! the first line and the secret on the second. It is JSON when its first byte that is not white
//! space is `{`. Only its owner may be able to read it (no group or other permission bit), and no
//! error names the secret.
