//! The lock of the cache directory, and the mode it decides.
//!
//! Two processes may have one cache directory open at once: a new release is started beside the
//! one that runs, and the old one exits when it has drained. Only one of them may write to the
//! directory. The one that holds the exclusive lock on `<path>/.lock` is read-write; the other is
//! read-only until the kernel frees the lock (the holder exited or crashed) and it takes it
//! itself. Nothing tells it to: [`LocalCache::tick`] tries the lock, and [`LocalCache::hold`]
//! calls it on an interval until it is halted.
//!
//! A read-only cache serves the hits its scan found from `obj/`, sends every miss and every write
//! to the upstream, and starts no fill, no keep, no eviction pass and no write of file times. It
//! creates, changes and removes nothing in the directory. An object the holder publishes after
//! the scan is not in the index of the read-only cache: it is a miss, answered from the upstream.
//!
//! A write-through delete or put sent to a read-only cache goes to the upstream, and the cache
//! forgets the object in its index, so a read of it goes to the upstream too. The holder's files
//! for it stay: the cache notes the name (at most `CacheConfig::forget_limit` names, 65536 by
//! default; past that it notes only that there were too many). When it takes the lock it removes
//! those files after the scan, before it is read-write, or, if there were too many, removes
//! every object file and starts with an empty index. What remains: the holder itself still
//! serves its cached copy of such an object, on the connections it is draining, until it exits.
//! That window ends with its drain, and a read-only cache cannot shorten it.
//!
//! Taking the lock runs what a start of a lone cache runs: it empties `.stage/` (the fills of
//! the one that held the lock are not kept), scans `obj/` again with deletes (a sidecar whose
//! data file was never linked is the middle of a publish that did not finish), and replaces the
//! index; only then does the cache say it is read-write. The holder checks, at every tick, that
//! `.lock` still leads to the file it holds: a file that was replaced is a lock that nothing
//! else looks at, so the cache lets it go, is read-only again, and takes the new file when it
//! can. A fill that is running then writes nothing more: it remembers the number of times the
//! cache lost the lock when it started (the generation), and asks before it makes its staging
//! file, before each chunk, inside the publish before the first change to the directory and
//! before the rename, and before the index. The names of the staging files start with a prefix of
//! the cache, so a cache never removes the staging file of another. The loss is noticed by a
//! tick, once a second at most: until then the cache still believes it holds the lock. A fill
//! that linked its object into the directory and then finds the lock lost removes the data file
//! and the sidecar it linked (the one delete a cache makes in a directory it does not own: the
//! names are its own). What is left of the window is a whole, valid object that is on the disk
//! for the moments until that removal, and the staging file of a fill, which is its own.
