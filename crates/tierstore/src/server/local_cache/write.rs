//! The writes of a cache with `write_through` on: each goes to the upstream before it is
//! acknowledged, so nothing is only local and there is nothing to recover.
//!
//! - **Create-only put** ([`put_through`](Inner::put_through), in `keep`): one HEAD of the key
//!   goes to the upstream before the body is read. An object that is there is
//!   [`AlreadyExists`](Error::AlreadyExists) at once, with no byte of the body read and no put
//!   sent (the S3 backend would otherwise upload all the parts of a large body and learn it at the
//!   completion). The HEAD only saves work: the upstream's create-only put is the one arbiter of
//!   two writers of one key, and its `AlreadyExists` is passed on as it is. An upstream that
//!   cannot answer the HEAD is the error of the put. Under a `cache = true` policy the object is
//!   also kept on the node (see `keep`).
//! - **Multipart** (create, part, complete, abort): passed to the upstream as they are and not
//!   kept (the first read fills the object). A completion that succeeds drops the cache's entry
//!   for the key, if it has one.
//! - **Delete** ([`delete_through`](Inner::delete_through)): the entry is dropped, then the
//!   upstream deletes. A fill that is running for the key does not keep the object it read (see
//!   [`forget`](Inner::forget)).
//! - **A put that replaces on a tag** (`put_if_match`) is not done, as on every front.
//!
//! The keys under `_journal/` and `_tiering/` belong to a storage node and are refused with
//! [`Error::Reserved`], as a storage node does.
