//! The reads of the cache as streams: the chunks of a read are handed on as they are read from a
//! file or from the upstream, so that a read holds one chunk (`fill_chunk` bytes) in memory
//! whatever the size of the object.
//!
//! - A hit is read from the object's file a chunk at a time.
//! - A miss whose fill runs is read from the file the fill stages, up to the bytes the fill has
//!   written, while the fill goes on: the readers of one key each read the file with a handle of
//!   their own and share no bytes in memory. The last `fill_chunk` bytes of the window a reader
//!   asked for are held back until the fill has ended and said whether the object is good (the
//!   hash of a key named by its content, the second HEAD of any other key, the link into
//!   `obj/`), so a body that is not good never ends with all of its bytes: it ends with the
//!   error of the fill, which the answer turns into a broken response, never a clean end.
//! - A read that goes to the upstream (a key that is not kept, a range of a large object, a miss
//!   that finds every fill running) is read a chunk at a time by ranged reads, each made when
//!   the one before has been taken.
