//! The local cache of a build node: a read-through disk cache in front of one upstream.
//!
//! A [`LocalCache`] is a [`Backend`] over an upstream [`Backend`] (an S3 endpoint, in the
//! binary: any S3 store, such as a bucket of MinIO or a storage node's tierstore). By default the S3 front serves it as a read cache and
//! refuses every write before it gets here (see `ServerConfig::cache`), so a cache has no
//! journal, no lease and no reconciler, and nothing to recover but a directory of files it can
//! delete. The only things that run on their own are the fills a miss starts, the eviction
//! pass ([`LocalCache::maintain`]) and the scrub ([`LocalCache::scrub`]).
//!
//! # Writes
//!
//! With [`CacheConfig::write_through`] (`write_through = true` in `[local_cache]`) the cache
//! accepts writes and sends every one of them to the upstream: nothing is acknowledged before
//! the upstream has it, and nothing is only local. The module `write` has what each call does.
//! A create-only put under a `cache = true` policy is also kept on the node (module `keep`):
//! the body is copied to `.stage/` as it streams to the upstream, and once the upstream has
//! acknowledged it and said what tag it gave the object, the copy is put in the cache before the
//! answer. That copy is best effort and never fails the put.
//! Without the setting every write call of the [`Backend`] is `Unsupported`, as the front
//! refuses it before.
//!
//! # What is kept
//!
//! A key is kept if the longest prefix of the policies that holds it says `cache = true` and it
//! is not under `_journal/` or `_tiering/`. Every other key, and every listing, goes to the
//! upstream as it is and is never kept.
//!
//! - A hit (HEAD, GET, ranged GET of an object that is in the cache) is answered from the disk
//!   and makes no call to the upstream.
//! - A miss on a whole GET fills the object. A miss on a ranged GET fills the whole object if it
//!   is at most 64 MiB, and otherwise passes the range through and keeps nothing. A HEAD of an
//!   object that is not kept goes to the upstream and fills nothing.
//! - The misses of one key fill it once: the first starts the fill on a task of its own, the
//!   others wait for it. A fill that no reader waits for any more still ends.
//!
//! # A fill
//!
//! The object is read from the upstream in chunks (ranged reads of `fill_chunk` bytes, so that a
//! fill holds one chunk in memory whatever the object's size), each chunk written to a file in
//! `<path>/.stage/` and hashed as it passes. The file is kept only if it is whole: the upstream
//! gave every byte of the size it said, and a key named by its content (`cas/l/<sha256>`) has
//! bytes that hash to the name. Then the sidecar is renamed into place and the file is linked
//! into `obj/` with a create-only link, so a name appears whole or not at all (layout:
//! [`layout`]). A fill that fails is counted by reason and removed.
//!
//! # A read
//!
//! A reader of the fill is given the bytes as the fill writes them (see `stream.rs`): every read
//! of the cache is a stream of chunks of at most `fill_chunk` bytes, so the memory of a read is a
//! chunk, not the size of the object. The readers of a key read the file the fill stages, all
//! through the one descriptor the fill writes it with (a read and a write at an offset share
//! nothing else), never a copy in memory. The last `fill_chunk` bytes of the window a reader asked
//! for are given only after the fill has said the object is good, so a ranged read of an object of
//! at most 64 MiB waits for the whole fill before its last chunk.
//!
//! - A fill that fails because the data is bad (the bytes do not hash to the name, the object was
//!   written over: a changed tag, or a short or long body) ends the readers' bodies with an
//!   error, never cleanly.
//! - A fill that a write or a delete through the cache marks (`forget`), or that fails for a
//!   reason of the cache (no room, the directory), is finished for each reader from the
//!   upstream, from the byte after the last one it was given. A reader given a byte goes on only
//!   if the upstream still has the version the byte came from (a HEAD, and another before the
//!   last chunk): it gets the error of the upstream (`NotFound` after a delete) or `Unavailable`
//!   after a write, never a clean end. A reader given no byte is answered as if there had been no
//!   fill. The bytes read this way are not hashed, as a pass-through never was.
//! - A read of more than one chunk from the upstream (a key not kept, a range over 64 MiB, the
//!   rest of a read) is held to the version it began with in the same way.
//! - A client that stops reading keeps the unlinked file of an evicted object, and its blocks, on
//!   the disk until the connection's idle time ends it: those blocks are outside the budget.
//!
//! A fill is skipped, and counted, when the object is larger than the budget or the cache, with the
//! bytes of the fills that are running, would pass its critical mark; the reader is served from
//! the upstream. A key that is not named by its content is read twice by HEAD, before the first
//! chunk and after the last: if the size or the tag changed, the object was written over during
//! the fill and is not kept, and the readers get an error. A key named by its content whose bytes
//! do not hash to the name is the reader's error, not passed through. A hit is not hashed again:
//! the scrub does that.
//!
//! At most `max_concurrent_fills` fills run at once, each holding one chunk (`fill_chunk`, 8 MiB)
//! in memory at a time, so the fills hold at most that many chunks. A miss of a key that has no
//! fill running, when every permit is taken, does not wait for one: it is served from the upstream
//! as a pass-through, keeps nothing and is counted in `fills_skipped` and `fills_skipped_busy`.
//! The readers of a key that has a fill running share it and need no permit. A fill that panics
//! or is cancelled frees its key and its permit, and the readers that waited for it get an error
//! (`Unavailable`, counted as a failed fill with the reason `aborted`).
//!
//! # Eviction
//!
//! The cache keeps its objects under `budget` bytes. Above `high_water` percent of it, and
//! whenever the file system's free space is under `free_floor` percent, a pass
//! ([`LocalCache::evict`]) removes the least recently used objects until the cache is down to
//! `low_water` percent and the free space is back at the floor. The order of use is in memory,
//! seeded at start from the files' times and written back to them (`utimensat`, once per object
//! per pass however often it was used) so that a restart keeps it. An object with more than one
//! link is in use by another tree: it is skipped, counted, and stays charged to the budget.
//! Files in `.stage/` are never evicted and are removed at start.
//!
//! # The lock and read-only mode
//!
//! A cache opened with [`LocalCache::open_locked`] takes an exclusive lock on `<path>/.lock`.
//! A second process over the directory (the next release, started beside the one that runs) is
//! read-only until the first exits: it serves the hits its scan found, sends every miss and every
//! write to the upstream, and creates, changes and removes nothing in the directory (no clean-up
//! at open, no probe, no fill, no eviction, no file time, no deletion on a read error). When the
//! lock is free, [`LocalCache::tick`] takes it, cleans up, scans again and makes the cache
//! read-write. The module `hold` has the rules.
//!
//! # Scrub
//!
//! A background walk hashes each object again at a bounded rate and drops the ones whose bytes
//! changed on the disk; see [`scrub`].
