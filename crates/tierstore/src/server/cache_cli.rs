//! The start of a build node: a [`LocalCache`] in front of one upstream, served by the S3 front
//! as a read cache, or as a cache that writes through when the file says `write_through`.
//!
//! The settings come from a file of the build-node shape (see
//! [`config_cache`](super::config_cache)). Before the address is bound the start asks the file
//! system under the cache the questions the layout stands on (see [`check_local`]; a file system
//! that answers one wrongly is exit status 3). The upstream is not tested or probed: an upstream
//! that cannot be reached, or a key that may not write, shows as the ordinary error of the first
//! request that meets it. A `budget` above the size of the file system less the `free_floor` is
//! refused as flags that cannot go together (exit status 2); a file system whose size cannot be
//! read, or that reports 0 bytes, is not judged: the start says so on stderr and goes on.
//!
//! With `write_through` the node writes to the upstream; without it the upstream is read with a
//! read-only key. What tierstore requires of the upstream is in the operations guide, and is not
//! verified.
//!
//! With an `[oci]` table the registry front runs beside the S3 one, over the same cache: a blob
//! or a manifest it reads is a hit on the disk or a fill from the upstream, as an S3 GET is. Its
//! flags and files are checked as a storage node's are (see `oci_setup_of`), before the cache is
//! opened, and it drains with the S3 front.
//!
//! The cache directory has a lock (`<path>/.lock`, see [`local_cache`](super::local_cache)). The
//! process that holds it is read-write; one that starts while another holds it is read-only: it
//! does not make the probe of the file system (the probe writes to the directory), `/readyz`
//! says `ready read-only`, and a task tries the lock every second, so that it becomes
//! read-write when the holder has exited. A start that is alone holds the lock before it binds
//! the address, so it is read-write from its first answer.
//!
//! On SIGTERM or SIGINT the process drains as a storage node does; the eviction pass and the
//! lock task are the only things running beside the server, and they stop with it. Nothing is
//! owed to the upstream: no journal, no lease, no copy in flight.
//!
//! A storage node with a cache in front of its own proxy (see
//! [`combined_cli`](super::combined_cli)) uses the same cache directory start (`open`), the same
//! sockets (`bind_cache_s3`) and the same two loops; its upstream is the proxy.
