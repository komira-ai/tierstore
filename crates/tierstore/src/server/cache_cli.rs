//! The start of a build node: a [`LocalCache`] in front of one upstream, served by the S3 front
//! as a read cache, or as a cache that writes through when the file says `write_through`.
//!
//! The settings come from a file of the build-node shape (see
//! [`config_cache`](super::config_cache)). Before the address is bound the start asks the file
//! system under the cache the questions the layout stands on (see [`check_local`]; a file system
//! that answers one wrongly is exit status 3, as for a tier that fails its self-test), and asks
//! the upstream a HEAD of a key that is not there, which it answers with 404 when it is up and
//! the key is accepted (an upstream that does not answer is exit status 1: a restart may mend
//! it). A `budget` above the size of the file system less the `free_floor` is refused as
//! flags that cannot go together (exit status 2); a file system whose size cannot be read, or
//! that reports 0 bytes, is not judged: the start says so on stderr and goes on.
//!
//! Without `write_through` the build node's upstream is read with a read-only key, so the write
//! checks of the storage node's self-test are not run against it. With it the node writes to the
//! upstream, and the start runs the whole self-test there (a create-only put that refuses a key
//! that exists, a multipart completion that does the same, and the reads the checks rest on)
//! under probe keys in `_tiering/selftest/`, which it deletes. An upstream that answers one of
//! them wrongly, a key that may not write included, is exit status 3; one that does not answer is
//! exit status 1, after the one try that the check of the start gives it. The probe keys that
//! earlier starts left are deleted after the start has reported itself ready, beside the server,
//! at most a hundred of them, and no new delete starts after ten seconds (see [`sweep_probes`]);
//! the rest waits for the next start.
//!
//! With an `[oci]` table the registry front runs beside the S3 one, over the same cache: a blob
//! or a manifest it reads is a hit on the disk or a fill from the upstream, as an S3 GET is. Its
//! flags and files are checked as a storage node's are (see `oci_setup_of`), before the cache is
//! opened, and it drains with the S3 front.
//!
//! The cache directory has a lock (`<path>/.lock`, see [`local_cache`](super::local_cache)). The
//! process that holds it is read-write; one that starts while another holds it is read-only: it
//! does not make the probe of the file system (the probe writes to the directory), `/readyz`
//! says `ready read-only`, and a task tries the lock every second, so that it becomes
//! read-write when the holder has exited. A start that is alone holds the lock before it binds
//! the address, so it is read-write from its first answer.
//!
//! On SIGTERM or SIGINT the process drains as a storage node does; the eviction pass and the
//! lock task are the only things running beside the server, and they stop with it. Nothing is
//! owed to the upstream: no journal, no lease, no copy in flight.
