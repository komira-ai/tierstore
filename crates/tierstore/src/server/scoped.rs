//! The scoped key: a header-signed key that reads, creates and deletes under prefixes the key
//! file lists, and does nothing else.
//!
//! A server has any number of them (`--scoped-key-file`, one file per key, mode 0600, the file
//! itself and owned by the user the server runs as):
//!
//! ```json
//! {"access_key_id": "frontend-packs", "secret_access_key": "...",
//!  "read_prefixes": ["cas/"],
//!  "write_prefixes": ["cas/f/fe1/"],
//!  "delete_prefixes": []}
//! ```
//!
//! All five fields are required and no other is allowed. Each prefix ends in `/` and is not
//! `_journal/` or `_tiering/`, under them, a prefix of them, or a path with one of those names as
//! a segment. The three lists may overlap, a list may be empty, and a key whose three lists are
//! all empty is refused (it could do nothing). A request signed by the key is allowed for the
//! calls below, and only for a key (or a list prefix) that starts with a prefix of the list the
//! call needs and, for a key, is longer than it, after the path is percent-decoded and with no
//! `..`, no `.` segment and no control character in it:
//!
//! - **read**: GetObject and HeadObject of such a key; ListObjectsV2 and ListMultipartUploads
//!   (`GET ?uploads`) with a `prefix` parameter that starts with a read prefix (a list with no
//!   prefix, or one outside, is refused and not filtered);
//! - **write**: a create-only PutObject (no `If-Match`, and `If-None-Match` absent or `*`), and
//!   the calls of a multipart upload of such a key: CreateMultipartUpload, UploadPart,
//!   CompleteMultipartUpload and AbortMultipartUpload;
//! - **delete**: DeleteObject of such a key.
//!
//! Everything else is `403 AccessDenied`, answered before the body is read: a replacing put
//! (`If-Match`), a copy (`x-amz-copy-source`, on a put or on a part), a call on the bucket itself
//! other than a listing, any method but `GET`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE`, a key or a
//! listing under `_journal/` or `_tiering/` (no prefix of a key can cover them), and a call on a
//! key outside the list its kind needs: a read prefix does not let the key write, and a write
//! prefix does not let it read. A put over a key that exists is `412` as for every create-only
//! put. The key is refused on a presigned URL (the URL's key must be a presigning key).
//!
//! The refusals come in this order: the signature and the key id, then the method, then the path
//! and query are decoded, then a listing of uploads is held to its `prefix` (a role's
//! `permit_list_uploads`, which runs before the checksum headers are read), then the checksum
//! headers of the request are read, and last the key, the list prefix and the headers are held to
//! the lists by [`permit`]. A call that is both refused and malformed may be answered with the
//! malformed-request error rather than 403.
