//! The read grant: a short signed token that lets a request `GET` or `HEAD` the objects it lists,
//! and nothing else.
//!
//! A grant is for a process that holds no S3 key and must read a known set of objects for a short
//! time (a build job reading the packs it needs). The process that mints it ([`mint_grant`]) holds
//! a grant key; the server holds the same key (`--grant-key-file`, [`ServerConfig::grant_keys`]),
//! checks the grant once per request, and allows a `GET` or `HEAD`, with any `Range`, of a listed
//! object. Every other request that carries a grant is `403 AccessDenied`, answered before its
//! body is read: another object, another method (a grant never writes, deletes or lists), a call
//! on the bucket, a multipart call, a query parameter but `x-id`, an expired grant, a grant for
//! another bucket, a grant whose signature does not match or whose key id the server does not
//! know. A request that carries both a grant and an `Authorization` header is refused too: a
//! request has one credential. The grant works wherever the S3 front does: on a storage node and
//! on a build node.
//!
//! A grant is a bearer token: whoever holds it can replay it until it expires, and on plain HTTP
//! anyone on the path can read it. The server also refuses a grant that ends more than
//! [`ServerConfig::grant_max_lifetime`] (15 minutes by default) after its own clock, so that no
//! grant is good for ever; the answer is the same 403 as for any other bad grant.
//!
//! # The token
//!
//! The request header is `x-tierstore-grant: <token>`, once. The token is
//!
//! ```text
//! token = base64url(body) "." base64url(tag)
//! tag   = HMAC-SHA256(key = the secret of the grant key, message = body)
//! body  = "tierstore-grant-v1" LF key-id LF bucket LF expires LF name { LF name }
//! ```
//!
//! `base64url` is the URL-safe alphabet of RFC 4648 section 5, without padding and without
//! trailing bits that are not zero. `LF` is the byte 0x0A; the body has none at its end. `key-id`
//! is the access key id of the grant key (printable ASCII, no `/`, `,` or `=`). `bucket` is the
//! bucket the server serves. `expires` is the unix time in seconds at which the grant ends, in
//! decimal digits without a sign or a leading zero: the grant is good while the server's clock
//! reads less than that. Each `name` is the exact key of an object (at most 1024 bytes, UTF-8, no
//! control character, no `..`, no `.` segment, not under `_journal/` or `_tiering/`, not empty);
//! there is at least one and at most [`MAX_GRANT_KEYS`], in strictly ascending order of their
//! bytes (so none twice). The header value is at most [`MAX_TOKEN_BYTES`] bytes.
//!
//! The server finds the key by `key-id`, checks the tag in constant time over the body exactly as
//! it was sent, and only then reads the rest. A byte changed anywhere in the body, or a tag made
//! with another secret, is refused.
