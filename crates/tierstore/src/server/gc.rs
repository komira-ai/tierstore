//! The garbage-collection key: a header-signed key that lists, heads and deletes under one
//! prefix and does nothing else.
//!
//! A server has any number of them (`--gc-key-file`, one file per key, mode 0600, the file
//! itself and owned by the user the server runs as):
//!
//! ```json
//! {"access_key_id": "pack-gc", "secret_access_key": "...", "prefix": "cas/b/"}
//! ```
//!
//! All three fields are required and no other is allowed. The prefix ends in `/` and is not
//! `_journal/` or `_tiering/` or under them or a prefix of them. A request signed by the key is
//! allowed, and only for a key (or a list prefix) that starts with the prefix of the key and is
//! longer than it, after the path is percent-decoded and with no `..`, no `.` segment and no
//! control character in it:
//!
//! - ListObjectsV2 with a `prefix` parameter inside the prefix of the key (a list with no prefix,
//!   or one outside, is refused and not filtered), and ListMultipartUploads (`GET ?uploads`) with
//!   such a prefix, under the same rule (the open uploads under the prefix are listed);
//! - HeadObject;
//! - DeleteObject, and AbortMultipartUpload of an upload of such a key.
//!
//! Everything else is `403 AccessDenied`, answered before the body is read: GetObject (a GC key never reads
//! a body), every `PUT` and `POST` (put, part, start and completion of an upload, copy), the calls
//! on the bucket itself, and every key under `_journal/` or `_tiering/`. The key is refused
//! on a presigned URL (the URL's key must be a presigning key), as a presigning key is refused in
//! the header.
//!
//! The refusals come in this order, none of them after the body is read: the signature and the key
//! id (403 or the signature errors), then the method (a `PUT` or `POST` is refused at once), then
//! the path and query are decoded (a bad encoding is 400, an unknown bucket 404), then the checksum
//! headers of the request are read (400 or 501), and last the key or list prefix is held to the
//! prefix of the key. So a call that is both refused and malformed may be answered with the
//! malformed-request error rather than 403.
//!
//! A delete through the proxy removes the object from both tiers and journals the delete, as for
//! any key; through a cache with `write_through` it drops the cache's copy of the object and then
//! deletes it at the upstream (there is no journal). **A delete by a GC key is not create-only: it is the only way an object leaves
//! `cas/b/`**, since the presigning key can only create, and the full key is not meant for the
//! frontend.
