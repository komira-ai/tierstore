# Configuration

tierstore is configured by flags, or by one TOML file given with `--config <path>`. The two make the same settings and run the same code: the file is read into the settings the flags make, and a key that is left out has the default of its flag. A file holds no secret, only the paths of key files.

> `--config` and `--print-config` came with v0.0.39, the build-node shape with v0.0.40; `--check-config` and `local_cache.write_through` are on main and not in v0.0.40. Every flag below works in every release. A file has one of two shapes, told apart by its tables: a storage node (a hot tier and a cold tier, as the flags have) and a build node (a read cache on local disk in front of one upstream, `[local_cache]`). The build node has no flag form.

## A file for a storage node

A hot tier on SSD in front of a cold tier on spinning disks, both directories:

```toml
[server]
listen            = "192.0.2.10:9000"
proxy_id          = "tierstore-1"
bucket            = "tierstore"
access_key_file   = "/etc/tierstore/access.key"
read_only_key_files = ["/etc/tierstore/daemons.key"]

[hot_store]
kind   = "dir"
path   = "/srv/tierstore/hot"
budget = "800GiB"

[cold_store]
kind = "dir"
path = "/srv/tierstore/cold"
```

The same with S3 buckets for the tiers, and every other key left at its default spelled out:

```toml
[server]
listen              = "192.0.2.10:9000"
proxy_id            = "tierstore-1"
bucket              = "tierstore"
region              = "us-east-1"
max_request_bytes   = 268435456
access_key_file     = "/etc/tierstore/access.key"
read_only_key_files = ["/etc/tierstore/daemons.key"]
presign_key_files   = ["/etc/tierstore/pack-presign.key"]
gc_key_files        = ["/etc/tierstore/pack-gc.key"]

[hot_store]
kind               = "s3"
bucket             = "tierstore-hot"
endpoint           = "http://s3-hot.example:9000"
region             = "us-east-1"
credentials_file   = "/etc/tierstore/hot.credentials"
budget             = "1TiB"
high_water         = 80
low_water          = 70
critical           = 95
copy_parallel      = 16
lease_ttl          = "30s"
reconcile_interval = "5s"
usage_stale_after  = "2m"
journal_linger     = "20ms"
journal_retention  = "24h"

[cold_store]
kind             = "s3"
bucket           = "tierstore-cold"
endpoint         = "http://s3-cold.example:9000"
credentials_file = "/etc/tierstore/cold.credentials"
skip_checks      = []
```

Start it with the file and nothing else but the per-run flags:

```sh
/usr/libexec/kbf/tierstore --config /etc/tierstore/tierstore.toml --drain-lb-wait 10s --drain-deadline 15m
```

## A file for a build node

A read cache in front of one upstream, with no hot tier. The file has `[local_cache]` and `[cold_store]` and no `[hot_store]`; the cold store is the upstream, read with a read-only key:

```toml
[server]
listen          = "127.0.0.1:9400"
proxy_id        = "tierstore-cache-1"
bucket          = "tierstore"
access_key_file = "/etc/tierstore-cache/access.key"

[local_cache]
path       = "/var/lib/tierstore-cache"
layout     = "digest-v1"
budget     = "40GiB"
high_water = 90
low_water  = 75
critical   = 95
free_floor = 10
max_concurrent_fills = 4

[cold_store]
kind             = "s3"
bucket           = "tierstore"
endpoint         = "http://s3-cold.example:9000"
credentials_file = "/etc/tierstore-cache/upstream-read.key"

[[policy]]
prefix = "cas/b/"
cache  = true
```

How the cache behaves is in [operations](operations.md#a-build-node). The file is started as a storage node's is, with `--config` and the per-run flags.

## Types

- A duration is a string of a whole number and `ms`, `s`, `m` or `h`: `250ms`, `15m`.
- A size is an integer of bytes, or a string of a whole number and `B`, `KiB`, `MiB`, `GiB` or `TiB`: `"500GiB"`.
- A path is a string. A list of paths is an array, and the flag it stands for is given once for each element.
- An address is a string, `"192.0.2.10:9000"` or `"[2001:db8::1]:9000"`. The two `listen` keys also take an array of addresses, and the flag is given once for each element; that is on main, not in v0.0.41, where a `listen` key is one string and a flag is given once. Only an address named twice is refused by the check of the file or the flags. A wildcard and a specific address on one port (`0.0.0.0:9000` and `192.0.2.10:9000`), or one address on both `--listen` and `--oci-listen`, are refused by the system at bind on Linux (the start fails, naming the address); on macOS and the BSDs `SO_REUSEADDR` can let such sockets share the port, so do not rely on the refusal there.
- A number above 9223372036854775807 cannot go in a file; as a flag it is accepted.

## `[server]`

| Key | Flag | Type, default | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `server.listen` | `--listen` | address or list of addresses, required | where the S3 API, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/usagez` and `/metricz` are served. On main, not in v0.0.41: a list (the flag given again for each address) is served on every address by one server, with one drain and one limit on connections, and a start that cannot bind every address is refused. To listen on the wildcard of both families give `0.0.0.0:<port>` and `[::]:<port>`: an IPv6 address is bound for IPv6 only, so the two do not clash. An address given twice is refused, naming the key |
| `server.proxy_id` | `--proxy-id` | string, required | names this process's journal and lease in the hot tier; keep it across restarts and give each process over the same tiers its own |
| `server.bucket` | `--bucket` | string, required | the one bucket clients see; not `healthz`, `readyz`, `usagez` or `metricz` |
| `server.region` | `--region` | string, `us-east-1` | the region in the credential scope of a request's signature (not the tiers' regions) |
| `server.access_key_file` | `--access-key-file` | path, required | the full key file |
| `server.read_only_key_files` | `--read-only-key-file` | paths, none | read-only key files |
| `server.presign_key_files` | `--presign-key-file` | paths, none | presigning key files |
| `server.gc_key_files` | `--gc-key-file` | paths, none | GC key files |
| `server.scoped_key_files` | `--scoped-key-file` | paths, none | scoped key files |
| `server.presign_max_expires` | `--presign-max-expires` | duration, `15m` | the longest expiry of any presigned URL |
| `server.max_request_bytes` | `--max-request-bytes` | bytes, 268435456 (256 MiB) | the longest body of a request: the longest object and the longest part. A body over it is refused with 413 and nothing is stored |
| `server.max_concurrent_puts` | `--max-concurrent-puts` | count, 32 | the most put bodies and parts taken at once; one more waits for one to end, up to `server.put_permit_wait` |
| `server.put_permit_wait` | `--put-permit-wait` | duration, `15s` | on main, not in v0.0.41. How long a put that finds every put slot taken waits for one to end before it is answered 503 `SlowDown` with `Retry-After: 1`; `0s` answers at once. No byte of its body is read while it waits, and a waiter counts as in flight in a drain (never past `--drain-deadline`) |
| `server.put_min_bytes_per_sec` | `--put-min-bytes-per-sec` | bytes a second, 1024 | the least average rate of a body, counted over the time spent waiting for the client; 0 turns it off |
| `server.put_rate_grace` | `--put-rate-grace` | duration, `30s` | the time spent waiting for the client before that rate is held |
| `server.body_idle_timeout` | `--body-idle-timeout` | duration, `30s` | how long a body or an answer may go without a byte; more than zero |
| `server.s3_request_timeout` | `--s3-request-timeout` | duration, `60s` | the limit on a request to an `s3` tier (both tiers); more than zero. Set it longer than the longest multipart completion your store takes |
| `server.backend_check_wait` | `--backend-check-wait` | duration, `5m` | how long the start-up self-test asks again of a tier that does not answer; `0s` asks once |

## `[hot_store]` and `[cold_store]`

Both tables have `kind` and the keys it needs. `kind` is `memory` (no other key), `dir` (needs `path`) or `s3` (needs `bucket`, `endpoint` and `credentials_file`; `region` is optional). As flags, a tier is `--hot` or `--cold` with `memory`, `dir:<path>` or `s3:<bucket>`, and the S3 keys are the flags below. A key the kind does not take is refused.

| Key | Flag | Type, default | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hot_store.kind`, `hot_store.path`, `hot_store.bucket` | `--hot` | required | the hot tier |
| `cold_store.kind`, `cold_store.path`, `cold_store.bucket` | `--cold` | required | the cold tier. Multipart uploads go straight to it, so it must do them (all three kinds do) |
| `hot_store.endpoint` | `--hot-endpoint` | `http://host[:port]`, required for `s3` | the hot tier's store. No path; TLS is not built yet |
| `hot_store.region` | `--hot-region` | string, `us-east-1` | the signing region of the hot tier's store |
| `hot_store.credentials_file` | `--hot-credentials-file` | path, required for `s3` | the key file of the hot tier's store |
| `cold_store.endpoint` | `--cold-endpoint` | `http://host[:port]`, required for `s3` | the cold tier's store |
| `cold_store.region` | `--cold-region` | string, `us-east-1` | the signing region of the cold tier's store |
| `cold_store.credentials_file` | `--cold-credentials-file` | path, required for `s3` | the key file of the cold tier's store |
| `cold_store.skip_checks` | `--skip-backend-check` | list of `CHECK=REASON`, none | the start-up check that is left out, with its reason. Only `multipart-conditional` can be skipped, and it needs a reason; it runs on the cold tier |

Only `[hot_store]` has these, since only a process with a hot tier has them:

| Key | Flag | Type, default | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hot_store.budget` | `--hot-bytes` | size, required | the bytes the hot tier is meant to hold. The water marks are shares of it |
| `hot_store.high_water` | `--high-water` | percent, 80 | above this share of the budget, eviction begins |
| `hot_store.low_water` | `--low-water` | percent, 70 | eviction goes on down to this share |
| `hot_store.critical` | `--critical` | percent, 95 | above this share a put waits a little first and a read of a cold object is not copied back |
| `hot_store.journal_linger` | `--journal-linger` | duration, `20ms` | how long a batch of journal entries waits for more |
| `hot_store.journal_retention` | `--journal-retention` | duration, `24h` | how long an applied journal object is kept |
| `hot_store.copy_parallel` | `--copy-parallel` | count, 16 | the most objects the reconciler copies at once |
| `hot_store.lease_ttl` | `--lease-ttl` | duration, `30s` | how long the reconciler's lease lasts without a renewal |
| `hot_store.reconcile_interval` | `--reconcile-interval` | duration, `5s` | how often the reconciler works; shorter than the lease |
| `hot_store.lock_file` | `--lock-file` | absolute path, none | on main, not in v0.0.41. the lock file of the node: the reconciler works only while this process holds an exclusive lock on it. A process that finds the lock held serves reads and writes through its own proxy and tries the lock again every second; the system frees it when the holder exits or crashes. If the file is replaced, the holder stops its reconciler and waits for the lock on the new file. Give every process of one node the same path, on a local file system, in a directory that nothing removes (`/var/lib/tierstore/`, not a directory under `/run`). The start refuses a path that is not absolute, one that names no file, and one that cannot be opened or is on a network file system. Without it the reconciler works as soon as the process starts |
| `hot_store.usage_stale_after` | `--usage-stale-after` | duration, `2m` | how old the published usage may be before `/usagez` says 503; longer than the lease |

The water marks are percents from 1 to 100. The start refuses `low_water` at or above `high_water`, `high_water` above `critical`, a `reconcile_interval` at or above `lease_ttl`, and a `usage_stale_after` at or below `lease_ttl`.

## `[local_cache]`

The read cache of a build node. A GET or HEAD of a key that a `[[policy]]` with `cache = true` holds is answered from the directory and filled from the upstream on a miss; every other call to the front but GET and HEAD is refused 403, unless `write_through` is `true`. The table has no flag.

| Key | Type, default | What |
|---|---|---|
| `local_cache.path` | path, required | the directory of the cache, made if it is not there; put it on the file system that the jobs' scratch is on |
| `local_cache.layout` | string, `"digest-v1"` | the only layout: raw bytes, one file for each object |
| `local_cache.budget` | size, required | the bytes the cache is meant to hold. The marks are shares of it |
| `local_cache.high_water` | percent, 90 | above this share of the budget, a pass evicts |
| `local_cache.low_water` | percent, 75 | a pass evicts down to this share; below `high_water` |
| `local_cache.critical` | percent, 95 | above this share a fill is skipped; not below `high_water` |
| `local_cache.free_floor` | percent, 10 (0 to 99) | the share of the file system that is kept free: below it a pass evicts, even under the budget. The budget may not be above the size of the file system less this share |
| `local_cache.max_concurrent_fills` | count, 4 (1 to 64) | the most fills that run at once; a miss that finds them all running is served from the upstream and kept nowhere |
| `local_cache.max_concurrent_keeps` | count, 8 (1 to 64) | on main, not in v0.0.41. The most create-only puts copied into the cache at once, apart from the fills; a put that finds them all running succeeds and is not kept. A process that does not hold the lock of the cache directory (see [operations](operations.md#the-cache-lock-and-read-only-mode)) keeps no put at all |
| `local_cache.keep_wait` | duration, `5s` (above 0) | on main, not in v0.0.41. The longest a put waits, once the upstream has the object, for its copy to land in the cache; past it the put is answered and the copy finishes in the background |
| `local_cache.keep_deadline` | duration, `60s` (above 0, not below `keep_wait`) | on main, not in v0.0.41. The longest a copy takes in all, from the upstream's acknowledgement; a copy not done by then is abandoned and its stage file removed |
| `local_cache.write_through` | boolean, `false` | `false`: the node refuses every write with 403. `true`: it takes the writes its keys may do and sends each to the upstream, which must then be read with a key that may write; the start runs the self-test of a storage node against the upstream and exits 3 if it answers one wrongly |
| `local_cache.whole_fill_limit` | size, 64 MiB (1 byte to `budget`) | on main, not in v0.0.41. the most an object may be for a ranged read of it to fill the whole of it; a larger object is passed through and kept nowhere. A fill reads 8 MiB at a time whatever the limit, so raising it does not raise the memory of the fills |
| `local_cache.cache` | boolean, `true` | `false` is refused: leave `[local_cache]` out to run without a cache |
| `local_cache.scrub_rate` | rate, `"16MiB/s"` | a size and `/s`, such as `"50MiB/s"`: the rate at which the scrub re-reads cached objects and hashes them again; `"off"` or `"0B/s"` turns the scrub off (not in a release yet, see [limits](limits.md)) |
| `local_cache.scrub_min_round` | duration, `"1h"` | the least time between the starts of two scrub rounds, so a small cache is not read again and again; at least `"1s"`, or `"0s"` for none |

The upstream is `[cold_store]`, with any `kind`. In place of `endpoint` it may have a list `endpoints` of exactly one entry. With `write_through = true` the node takes create-only puts, presigned puts, multipart uploads and deletes, and sends each to the upstream before it answers; the keys' roles apply as on a storage node, and a put that replaces (`If-Match`) and a copy are still refused. On main (not in v0.0.41) a create-only put under a `cache = true` prefix is also kept on the node before it is answered, so its next read is a local hit; a copy that cannot be kept never fails the put. A build node leaves out `skip_checks` and the reconciler's keys and `server.backend_check_wait`. On main (not in v0.0.41) it may have an `[oci]` table: the registry front then reads through the cache, and the start refuses the file unless a `[[policy]]` with `cache = true` covers the blobs, the keys under `blobs/sha256/` below `oci.prefix`.

## `[oci]`

The read-only OCI registry front. The table is the front: leave it out for a server with none. `listen` is needed in it and the other keys are refused without it.

```toml fragment
[oci]
listen              = "192.0.2.10:5000"
tls_cert_file       = "/etc/tierstore/oci.crt"
tls_key_file        = "/etc/tierstore/oci.key"
prefix              = "oci/"
max_connections     = 64
connection_lifetime = "1h"
```

| Key | Flag | Type, default | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `oci.listen` | `--oci-listen` | address or list of addresses | where the front listens. With a certificate and key it is HTTPS; with neither it is plain HTTP, and off loopback the start prints one warning line for each such address. On main, not in v0.0.41: a list (the flag given again for each address) is served on every address by the one front, with one limit on connections and one drain, as `server.listen` is; an address given twice is refused, naming the key |
| `oci.tls_cert_file` | `--oci-tls-cert` | path | the certificate chain (PEM), leaf first. It must carry an IP subjectAltName for each listen address. Both this and the key, or neither |
| `oci.tls_key_file` | `--oci-tls-key` | path | the private key (PEM); a file any user can read is refused |
| `oci.prefix` | `--oci-prefix` | string, `oci/` | the key prefix, ending in `/`; not inside `_journal/` or `_tiering/` |
| `oci.max_connections` | `--oci-max-connections` | count, 64 (at least 1) | connections open at once |
| `oci.connection_lifetime` | `--oci-connection-lifetime` | duration, `1h` | the longest a connection lives |

On main, not in v0.0.41, `listen` may be a list, here the wildcard of both families:

```toml fragment
[oci]
listen = ["0.0.0.0:5000", "[::]:5000"]
```

The front reads objects at `<prefix>blobs/sha256/<hex>` and serves GET and HEAD of `/v2/`, of manifests by digest and of blobs by digest. It is anonymous: anyone who can connect can read any digest under the prefix, so the network decides who may. Tags are not served. The certificate and key are read once; a new certificate takes a restart.

## `[[policy]]`

`[[policy]]` has a `prefix` (empty for all the rest, or ending in `/`) and `cache`. On a storage node a policy is read and checked and has no effect, and `policy.cache = true` is refused, since it has no cache. On a build node a key is kept if the longest prefix that holds it says `cache = true`, and at least one policy must say so. Two non-empty prefixes may not nest, a prefix may not be listed twice, and none may lie under `_journal/` or `_tiering/`.

## The flags that stay flags

These describe one run, not the data path, and have no key:

| Flag | Default | What |
|---|---|---|
| `--config` | none | the file |
| `--print-config` | off | print the file for the flags given, and exit |
| `--check-config` | off | with `--config`: load the file, read the key files it names, and for an `[oci]` table check the prefix, the connection lifetime and the TLS files; then exit 0 and print nothing, or print the refusal and exit 2. It binds nothing and asks no store. What it does not check is listed below. Without `--config` it is a usage error |
| `--capabilities` | off | on main, not in v0.0.41. print what this build can do, one capability to a line, and exit 0 (a build with none prints nothing). It needs none of the flags a start requires, and with any other argument it prints nothing on stdout, says `--capabilities takes no other flag` on stderr and exits 2 |
| `--drain-lb-wait` | `10s` | on SIGTERM, the settle: how long `/readyz` says 503 while the server goes on accepting and serving |
| `--drain-deadline` | `15m` | then how long it waits for requests in flight and for the connections it closes (on main, not in v0.0.41: a lingering close, see [operations](operations.md#drain-and-restart)) |

`--check-config` finds what the loader refuses (see "What the loader refuses"), a `bucket` that is a probe path name, a zero `body_idle_timeout`, a key file that is not owned by the user, is open to others or is a link, two keys with one id, and, in the file of a build node, a zero `s3_request_timeout`. It does not find what a start checks after that: the water marks out of order, `reconcile_interval` not below `lease_ttl`, `usage_stale_after` not above `lease_ttl`, or a zero `s3_request_timeout` in a storage node's file (a start exits 1 on each, and the unit tries again every 30 seconds); a tier that is down or answers the self-test wrongly; the cache directory and a `budget` over the size of its file system. A file that passes `--check-config` can still fail to start.

`--help` and `--version` are the usual; on main `--version` prints the version, `+` and the commit the binary was built from (`tierstore 0.2.0+0123456789ab`), and the start line ends with ` commit=<commit>`. The commit is twelve hex digits, or `unknown` for a build that had neither a git checkout nor a stamp. A start that gives `--config` and any other flag but `--drain-lb-wait`, `--drain-deadline` and `--check-config` is refused with exit status 2.

## What the loader refuses

Each of these exits with status 2 and names the file and the key (a syntax error names the line and the column, never the value):

- a key or a table the format does not have, and a value of the wrong type;
- a key that holds a secret: keys and credentials are paths of files whose names end in `_file` or `_files`; `secret_access_key`, `access_key_id`, `password`, a name with `token` in it and the like are refused anywhere;
- a file that is neither a storage node's (`[hot_store]` and `[cold_store]`) nor a build node's (`[local_cache]` and `[cold_store]`, no `[hot_store]`), and all three tables together;
- in a build node's file, an `[oci]` table, a `layout` other than `digest-v1`, `cache = false`, marks out of order, no `[[policy]]` with `cache = true`, and more than one entry in `endpoints`;
- a key a tier's `kind` does not take, a `dir` tier without `path`, an `s3` tier without `bucket`, `endpoint` or `credentials_file`, and a key only one tier has in the other (`budget` and the reconciler's keys belong to `[hot_store]`, `skip_checks` to `[cold_store]`);
- a water mark outside 1 to 100, and a budget, count or limit of zero;
- an `[oci]` table without `listen`, with only one of the certificate and the key, or with `max_connections = 0`;
- on main, not in v0.0.41: a `server.listen` or `oci.listen` that is an empty list or names one address twice;
- a `[[policy]]` that breaks the rules above.

## Moving from flags to a file

`tierstore --print-config`, given the flags of a unit and not `--config`, prints on stdout the file that is equivalent to them and exits 0 without starting anything. It names key files by path and never prints what is in them, and the file it prints is loaded back before it is printed, so it loads. Take the flags out of `ExecStart=`:

```sh
/usr/libexec/kbf/tierstore --print-config --listen 192.0.2.10:9000 ... > /etc/tierstore/tierstore.toml
```

Then change `ExecStart=` to the `--config` line above, keeping `--drain-lb-wait` and `--drain-deadline`. It does not convert anything else in a unit. If `--print-config` cannot write its output (a closed pipe, a full disk) it exits 1; a refusal of the flags exits 2.

## Not in a release yet

- **Several upstream endpoints.** A cache node listing more than one upstream, with failover between them.
