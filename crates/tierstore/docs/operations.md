# Operations

## Starting

Start the unit by hand (see [install](install.md)). Before it opens the proxy or binds the address, the process runs the start-up self-test (below). When it is ready it prints one line on stdout:

```text
tierstore <version> listen=192.0.2.10:9000
```

With the OCI front on, the line gets ` oci-listen=<address> (https)` or ` (http)` after the listen address. With more than one address of a kind (on main, not in v0.0.41) the value is every address, in the order given, separated by commas with no space: `listen=0.0.0.0:9000,[::]:9000`. The self-test's progress and every other message go to stderr, and so to the journal.

## Probes

Four paths of the S3 listener answer a GET or HEAD without a signature, so a bucket cannot have any of these names.

| Path | Answer | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `/healthz` | 200 `ok` while the process runs | liveness |
| `/readyz` | 200 `ready` until the drain begins, then 503 `draining` | a load balancer's health check |
| `/usagez` | 200 with the age of the hot tier's published usage, or 503 with the reason | alerting |
| `/metricz` | 200 with the counters, in the Prometheus text format (see [Metrics](operations.md#metrics)) | scraping |

`/readyz` does not look at the usage: one stopped reconciler would otherwise make every node unready. `/usagez` is for alerting, not for a load balancer.

On main, not in v0.0.41, the 200 of a build node says which mode its cache is in: `ready read-write` or `ready read-only` (see [the cache lock](operations.md#the-cache-lock-and-read-only-mode)). The status is the same in both: a read-only node serves.

## Usage

The reconciler publishes the hot tier's usage every pass. `/usagez` says:

```text
usage published <N>s ago
no usage yet, <N>s since start
usage of the hot tier is stale: published <N>s ago, limit <M>s
usage of the hot tier is missing: none published in <N>s, limit <M>s
```

The first two are 200 and the last two 503. The limit is `--usage-stale-after` (`hot_store.usage_stale_after`, 2m by default). A server that starts before the reconciler's first pass is 200 for that long. Puts ignore a usage older than 30 seconds, as if the hot tier were not full, so a stopped reconciler means a hot tier that is never taken to be full. Puts are not refused; alert on `/usagez`.

## Eviction and the water marks

The hot tier's size is measured against `--hot-bytes` (`hot_store.budget`). Three shares of it matter:

- Above `--high-water` (80% by default) the reconciler evicts the oldest objects that the cold tier already holds, until the hot tier is down to `--low-water` (70%). It never evicts an object it has not copied.
- Above `--critical` (95%) a put waits a short time before it is written, and a read of an object that is only in the cold tier is served but not copied back into the hot tier.
- At the budget, or when the hot tier says it is full, new objects are written straight to the cold tier.

Eviction frees the hot tier only as fast as the cold tier takes copies, which `--copy-parallel` bounds. If the cold tier is slow or down, copies stall, nothing becomes evictable, and the hot tier climbs to the budget.

## What a full disk does

A `dir` hot tier whose disk is out of space, or an `s3` hot tier that answers 507, is a full hot tier: the put that met it goes to the cold tier where nothing of its body was taken yet, and the tier is taken to be full for a moment. A put that had already streamed some of its body into the hot tier fails, and the client's retry goes to the cold tier. Reads use both tiers throughout. The hot tier is used again once the usage falls. Objects written straight to the cold tier are not journaled and not copied; the reconciler has nothing to do for them.

If the cold tier is a full disk, puts that reach it fail. A tier that is full at start still starts; the start-up checks that need a write are skipped, with a line that says so. Size `--hot-bytes` below the real capacity of the SSD: the budget is what the process compares with, not what the file system has.

## Drain and restart

On SIGTERM or SIGINT (what `systemctl stop` sends) the process drains:

1. `/readyz` answers 503 at once, and every answer from then on carries `Connection: close`, so that a client does not send its next request on a connection that is about to end;
2. for `--drain-lb-wait` (10s), the settle, the server goes on accepting connections and serving everything, so that a load balancer sees the 503 and a connection that was routed here a moment ago is served, not reset;
3. at the end of the settle it stops accepting connections and closes each connection that has no request on the wire with a lingering close: it shuts its end for writing, so that the client reads a clean end of stream, and goes on reading until the client closes its end, or for 60 seconds at most (the time an idle connection is let to wait for its next request, which has no flag), and then closes;
4. a request that is on the wire at that moment (begun, and not answered in full) is served, with `Connection: close`, never answered 503, and its connection is closed in the same way once the answer is out;
5. it waits for the requests in flight and for the connections to close, at most `--drain-deadline` (15m) in all;
6. it gives up the reconciler's lease and exits 0.

A request that arrives within one round trip of the end of the stream, on a connection that was idle since before the drain began, cannot be answered: the client sent it before it read the end of the stream. The server reads and drops it and counts the connection in `tierstore_drain_late_requests_total`. A client that follows `Connection: close` never meets this; a client that retries such a request must be sure the request is safe to repeat, which a create-only put is not. This drain, the lingering close and the metric are on main, not in v0.0.41; v0.0.41 and before answer every request on a connection that is open after the settle 503 `ServiceUnavailable` with `Connection: close`.

A request cut at the deadline is counted on stderr: `tierstore: <N> requests were cut at the drain deadline`. Another process over the same tiers takes the reconciler's lease once it is given up or has expired (`--lease-ttl`). State is in the tiers, not the process, so a restart needs nothing but the same `--proxy-id`.

To restart for a new binary or a new key file, replace the file, then `systemctl restart tierstore`; run more than one process, with ids of their own, if clients must not see the pause.

On main, not in v0.0.41, `--lock-file` (`hot_store.lock_file`) says which of the processes over one node reconciles. A process that holds an exclusive lock on the file runs the reconciler and takes the lease. A process that finds the lock held serves reads and writes through its own proxy at once and does not touch the reconciler's state in the hot tier, the lease included, until it holds the lock; it tries every second. The system frees the lock when the holder exits or crashes, so a process started beside the one that is draining reconciles as soon as that one has exited and given its lease up. Give both processes the same file, on a local file system, in a directory that nothing removes: a directory under `/run` that systemd removes with the unit would let a third process make a new file and lock it beside the second. The holder looks before each pass at whether the path still leads to the file it locked; if the file was replaced, it gives its lease up and waits for the lock on the new file. A start whose lock file cannot be opened, is a link or is on a network file system exits 1. Without the flag the reconciler works as soon as the process starts, as before.

## The start-up self-test

Before it serves, the process asks each tier, under a probe key in `_tiering/selftest/` that is new for each start and deleted afterwards, the questions its guarantees rest on: a create-only put refuses a key that exists, an `If-Match` put replaces only on the right content tag, a range read gives the range, a head has `Last-Modified`, a listing honors `start-after`, and on the cold tier a multipart completion is create-only. A tier that answers one wrongly exits the process with status 3, naming the tier, the check and the answer. A tier that cannot be reached is asked again, with pauses from one second doubling to thirty, for `--backend-check-wait` (5m), and then the start exits 1.

The same prefix can hold probe keys that a start which was killed left behind. A start deletes the ones older than an hour, at most 100 keys each time, and no new delete starts after 10 seconds; a request already sent can take up to `--s3-request-timeout`. When it has run it writes one line to stderr: `tierstore: <tier>: swept N stale probe keys in T ms`, with `(more left)` when a limit stopped it; the rest is deleted at a later start. If the sweep cannot read the time of the store or list the keys, it writes a `could not …` note instead of that line. A storage node does this after the checks and before it binds its address, so it can wait about those 10 seconds for each tier, plus the request in flight. A build node with `write_through` does it after it has printed its ready line, beside the server, so the sweep never delays readiness.

`--skip-backend-check multipart-conditional=<reason>` leaves out the last check, for a store you have shown to be safe another way; the reason is written to stderr at every start. No other check can be skipped.

## A build node

A build node (the file has `[local_cache]`, see [configuration](configuration.md#a-file-for-a-build-node)) serves the S3 front as a read cache. What it keeps: a key is kept if the longest `[[policy]]` prefix that holds it says `cache = true` (and it is not under `_journal/` or `_tiering/`). A GET or HEAD of a kept object is answered from the disk with no call to the upstream. A GET of one that is not there is read from the upstream in chunks of 8 MiB into a staging directory, hashed as it passes, and linked into place only when it is whole; the misses of one key share one fill. A ranged GET of a miss fills the whole object if it is at most 64 MiB, and otherwise passes the range through and keeps nothing. A fill that fails never fails the reader for the cache's reasons: the reader is answered from the upstream. Every call but GET and HEAD is refused 403 `AccessDenied`.

Put `cache = true` only on prefixes whose objects are never rewritten, the content-addressed ones: a kept object is never checked against the upstream again. Anyone who may read through the front may read what the upstream's key can read, so give clients scoped keys.

Memory is bounded for the fills: at most `local_cache.max_concurrent_fills` chunks of 8 MiB are held. A miss that finds every slot taken is served from the upstream and kept nowhere; if the count of such skips climbs, raise the key. A response is held whole in memory, as for any backend.

Eviction keeps the cache under `local_cache.budget`: above `high_water` percent of it, or when the free space of the file system is under `free_floor` percent, a pass (every 10 seconds) removes the least recently used objects down to `low_water` percent and until the free space is back at the floor. The free-space floor only triggers a pass; it does not stop a fill. An object that another tree has linked is skipped, counted and stays charged to the budget. A fill is skipped when the object is larger than the budget or would take the cache above `critical`.

At start the process makes the directory, removes what a fill left half done, reads the kept objects back (sizes only; an object whose sidecar does not say what the file holds is deleted), and asks the file system four questions with a probe object. A file system that answers one wrongly exits the process with status 3, naming the check. It then asks the upstream for a key that is not there: 404 or any object is an answer, and anything else exits 1. On SIGTERM it drains as a storage node does.

### The cache lock and read-only mode

On main, not in v0.0.41. Two processes may have one cache directory open at once, for example a new binary started beside the one that is draining. Only one of them writes to it. The directory has a lock file, `.lock`, and the process that holds an exclusive lock on it is read-write: it fills, keeps, evicts and records the use of objects. A process that finds the lock held is read-only. A lone process takes the lock before it binds the address, so it is read-write from its first answer; the system frees the lock when the holder exits or crashes.

A read-only process serves what its scan of the directory found, from the disk, and sends every other read and every write to the upstream. It makes and removes nothing in the directory and stamps no file: it does not empty the staging directory or delete a half-published object at start, skips the start-up probe of the file system, deletes nothing when a read of a kept object fails (the read is answered from the upstream), and starts no fill, no keep of a put, no eviction pass and no write of file times. A create-only put that reaches it with `write_through` goes to the upstream and succeeds, with no copy made in the directory; it is counted as `read_only` in `tierstore_cache_write_keep_skipped_total`. An object the holder keeps after the scan is read from the upstream until the process takes the lock. The counters of fills and evictions (`fills_total`, `evictions_total`, `fill_failures_total`) stay at 0 in a read-only process; hits, misses and bytes count.

With `write_through`, a delete or put sent to a read-only process goes to the upstream, and from then on the process reads that key from the upstream. The files the holder has for it stay on the disk, because the process may not remove them; the process notes the names, at most 65536 of them. When it takes the lock it removes those files after its scan and before it is read-write, so a deleted or replaced object is never served from the files the holder left. If more than 65536 keys were deleted or replaced, the process does not know which, and it removes every object file when it takes the lock and starts with an empty cache. One window is left: the holder itself still serves its own cached copy of such an object on the connections it is draining, until it exits. It ends with the holder's drain (`--drain-deadline` at most).

A cache that loses its lock (the lock file was replaced, see below) stops writing at once: a fill or the copy of a put (a keep) that is running publishes nothing, and the put is counted as `read_only`, and neither touches the staging files of the process that holds the directory now, which are named with a prefix of their own. The loss is noticed by the one-second try, so for up to that second a fill or a keep still believes it owns the directory. A fill or keep that has linked its object into the directory when it finds the loss removes the data file and the sidecar it linked (they are its own: no other process makes those names), so the object is not left where the new holder does not index it. What is left of the window is a whole, valid object that is on the disk for the moments until that removal.

The process tries the lock every second. When it takes it, it empties the staging directory, scans the directory again (deleting what is not a whole object) and only then is read-write; stderr says so, and the first line of the start says which mode it started in. `/readyz` says the mode in its body and `tierstore_cache_mode` in the metrics (see [metrics](metrics.md)); the status of `/readyz` does not depend on it. A holder looks at each try whether `.lock` still leads to the file it locked: a file that was removed or replaced is a lock that no other process looks at, so the holder lets it go, is read-only, and takes the new file when it can. A lock file that is a link, or on a network file system, stops the start (exit 1); a try that fails later is said on stderr and made again.

## Metrics

`GET /metricz` on the S3 listener (unsigned) answers 200 in the Prometheus text format. On main it has the hit, miss, byte and cold-read counters of the hot and cold tiers, the counters of the OCI read front, such as `tierstore_oci_requests_total`, and the counters of the cache of a build node, all named `tierstore_` and a word; without `--oci-listen` it says the front is not enabled, and a node with no cache says so on a line of its own. The tier counters are on main and not in v0.0.40. The full list of metric names, their labels and queries to alert on is in [metrics](metrics.md).

## Not in a release yet

- **Waiting for a put slot** (on main, not in v0.0.41). A put over `--max-concurrent-puts` waits up to `--put-permit-wait` (15 s) for a slot before it is answered 503 `SlowDown`, and the kbf task client retries a 503 with jittered waits. In v0.0.41 it is answered 503 at once.
