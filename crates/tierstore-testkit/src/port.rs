//! Loopback ports for tests: ports nothing listens on, and ports a server is to bind
//! later, without the window between "probed free" and "bound" that a socket bound to
//! `127.0.0.1:0` and dropped leaves open.
//!
//! In that window another test binding `127.0.0.1:0`, or a connection's source port,
//! takes the number. A test that wants a dead port then reaches the thief (a TLS
//! server answering where "connection refused" was expected), and a server that is
//! to bind the number later fails with "Address already in use".
//!
//! - [`dead_addr`]: an address on which connecting is refused, for as long as the test
//!   binary runs.
//! - [`Reserved`]: a port held until the test is ready, and then turned into the
//!   listener (no second bind, so nothing can come between).
//! - [`own_loopback_port`]: for a port a *child process* or code that binds by itself
//!   will bind, so no socket can be handed over.
//!
//! # What holds a port and refuses
//!
//! - Linux: a TCP socket that is bound and not listening owns its port (a second
//!   `bind` fails with `EADDRINUSE`; neither this module nor `std` sets
//!   `SO_REUSEADDR` on the held one) and a connection attempt to it is answered with a
//!   reset: `connect` fails with "connection refused".
//! - macOS: that socket owns its port too, but a SYN that finds it is dropped without
//!   a reset (the socket is in the lookup tables in state CLOSED, and the stack drops
//!   segments for a CLOSED socket), so `connect` waits out its whole timeout and
//!   fails with "timed out". So the held socket is also connected, to a peer socket of
//!   this process (a listener on a port of its own, whose accepted connection is
//!   kept): a connected socket is found only under its full address pair, so a SYN
//!   from anyone else finds no socket, is answered with a reset, and the port stays
//!   owned: the kernel skips a port that is in use when it picks one (a bind of
//!   port 0, a connection's source port), and a bind without `SO_REUSEADDR` fails
//!   with `EADDRINUSE`. A bind of exactly that number *with* `SO_REUSEADDR` (what
//!   `std` does) succeeds on macOS, so a test that probes by hand uses [`is_taken`].
//!   (Connecting the socket to its own address, which would need no peer, is
//!   refused by macOS with `EINVAL`.) [`Reserved::listen`] has to drop that socket
//!   and its peer and bind the listener; between the two a thief would need to draw
//!   exactly that number from the kernel's random ephemeral range within
//!   microseconds (on Linux the socket itself listens and there is no gap).
//!
//! The tests below prove the behaviour on the platform they run on, macOS included.
