//! A child process a test starts, and the guarantee that it does not outlive the test.
//!
//! [`Reaped`] holds a [`Child`] and, when dropped (a passing test, a failed assertion, a
//! panic, an early return), asks it to stop with SIGTERM, waits up to [`GRACE`], then
//! kills it with SIGKILL, and waits for it, so no process is left running and none is
//! left a zombie. [`spawn`] is the one way tests here start such a child: it also makes
//! every descriptor from a given number up close on exec, so the child holds only the
//! descriptors the test meant it to. Without that, a test run under a tool that keeps a
//! lock open on descriptor 9 (the build box's slot lock does) hands the lock to every child
//! it starts, and a leaked child holds the lock for as long as it lives.
//!
//! See also [`crate::spawn`] (a start retried while the program is busy) and
//! [`crate::forked`] (a child held between `fork` and `exec`): they cover the other ways a
//! forked child touches a test's descriptors.
