//! `channels apt write --bucket <b> --distribution-id <id> --hostname <h> --next <dir> (--debs <dir>
//! --version <V> | --no-pool) [--suite stable|testing] [--last] [--output <file>] [--aws
//! <program>]`: the signed index and the packages into the apt repository.
//!
//! The order is what keeps a reader consistent when the write stops anywhere:
//!
//! 1. the packages (none with `--no-pool`: the promotion of a release from `testing` to `stable`
//!    writes the index only, the pool holds the packages already), each with `If-None-Match: *` (a `412` means it exists; it is kept only when
//!    its bytes are ours, and a different file under the name is a failure: a package is never
//!    overwritten, and the index must not list a file that is not this one);
//! 2. the by-hash copy of every `Packages` and `Packages.gz`
//!    (`main/binary-<arch>/by-hash/SHA256/<hash>`, `If-None-Match`; the `Release` says
//!    `Acquire-By-Hash: yes`), so a client with the old `Release` finds the old files and one
//!    with the new `Release` the new, whatever part of this write has happened;
//! 3. the `Packages` files, then `Release`, `Release.gpg` and `InRelease` last, each with
//!    `If-Match` on the ETag `apt-read` saw (`If-None-Match` for an object that did not exist).
//!    The `If-Match` of `InRelease` is the commit point.
//!
//! A `412` on the index means someone else wrote in between: `conflict=true` is appended to
//! `--output` and the verb ends green, so the next attempt reads again; with `--last` it fails
//! instead. Before anything is written, the index must list exactly the packages to upload (by
//! name and digest) and each `Packages` must be the file its `Release` lists. Then
//! `/apt/dists/*` is invalidated.
