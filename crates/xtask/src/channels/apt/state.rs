//! What the shared index consists of, and what was read of it. Pure functions over text.
//!
//! The repository is one tree of object keys under `apt/`. The index of a suite (`stable`,
//! `testing`) is a handful of objects under `apt/dists/<suite>/`: for each architecture a `Packages` and a
//! `Packages.gz`, and `Release`, `InRelease` and `Release.gpg`. Every write to one of them is
//! conditional on the version that was read (its ETag), so the ETag of each object is kept beside
//! the copy of it in a text file, `etags.txt`, one `<path><TAB><etag>` line per object, `-` for an
//! object that did not exist. Ported from buildrules' `tools/deploy/apt_publish/state.zig`.
